# What's easy to do in Scala? What's not?
I really apreciated how easy it was to do if, then, else statements in Scala. I like how it gives you freedom on how you can write it. You don't have to use a bunch of brackets, but you still can if you want to. Learning how to debug was pretty difficult, but once I got the hang of it, it was pretty understandable. 

# Sor far, what is/are your favorite language design choice(s) that the designers of Scala made? Why?
I like how you don't have to write "return" to return a value at the end of the function. It is something that just saves time and makes the code look a lot better. 

# So far, what is/are your least favorite language design choice(s)? Why? And why do you think the designers made that / those choice(s)?
I didn't like how you couldn't just add two characters together to make a string even though you could add a character to a string. A workaround I had to do was add a character to an empt string and then add the other character. That seemed pretty uneccessary to me but the designers probably made that choice to prevent type errors. 

# What Scala features would you like to learn more about?
I would like to learn more about lists and also learn about dictionaries.
